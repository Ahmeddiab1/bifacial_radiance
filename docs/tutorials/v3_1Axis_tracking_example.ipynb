    "<b> CumulativeSky: True</b> gencumsky has been modified to divide the yearly-cumulative sky into various skies, each one representing the cumulative irradiance for the hours at which the tracker is at a certain angle. For faster running, for a tracker that moves between 60 and -60 degrees limit angle, if only positions every 5 degrees are considered (60, 55, 50 ... -55, -60), then only 25 skies (and 25 simulations) will be run for the whole year.\n",

A good computer and a ton of patience are needed for doing the ~4000 daylight-hours of the year, or else a high-performance-computing for handling full year simulations. The procedure can be broken into shorter steps for one day or a single timestamp simulation which is exemplified below.\n",
