    "Method <b> Gencumsky </b> has been modified to divide the yearly-cumulative sky into various skies, each one representing the cumulative irradiance for the hours at which the tracker is at a certain angle. For faster running, for a tracker that moves between 45 and -45 degrees limit angle, if only positions every 5 degrees are considered (45, 40, 35 .... -4-, -45), then only 18 skies (and 18 simulations) will be run for the whole year.\n",
