    "Example demonstrating Radiance gencumulativesky for 1-axis tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites (Step 0):\n",
    "This software requires the previous installation of RADIANCE from https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you add radiance to the system PATH so Python can interact with the radiance program\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on a PC you should also copy the Jaloxa radwinexe-5.0.a.8-win64.zip executables into `program files/radiance/bin`: http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 1: Install and import bifacial_radiance\n",
    "\n",
    " - clone the bifacial_radiance repo to your local directory\n",
    " - navigate to the \\bifacial_radiance directory which contains setup\n",
    " - run `pip install -e .  `  ( the period . is required, the -e flag is optional and installs in development mode where changes to the bifacial_radiance.py files are immediately incorporated into the module if you re-start the python kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 2: Move gencumulativesky.exe\n",
    "Copy gencumulativesky.exe from the repo's `/bifacial_radiance/data/` directory and copy into your Radiance install directory.\n",
    "This is typically found in `/program files/radiance/bin/`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 3: Create a local Radiance directory for storing the scene files created\n",
    "Keep scene geometry files separate from the bifacial_radiance directory.  Create a local directory somewhere that will be referenced in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 4: Reboot the computer\n",
    "This makes sure the PATH is updated\n",
    "\n",
