    "<b> CumulativeSky: True</b> gencumsky has been modified to divide the yearly-cumulative sky into various skies, each one representing the cumulative irradiance for the hours at which the tracker is at a certain angle. For faster running, for a tracker that moves between 60 and -60 degrees limit angle, if only positions every 5 degrees are considered (60, 55, 50 ... -55, -60), then only 25 skies (and 25 simulations) will be run for the whole year.\n",
